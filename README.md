# space-grid

When I was in middle school, I was a fan of the Flash game [Star
Relic](https://armorgames.com/play/5986/star-relic) (no longer
playable in modern browsers, but it works alright in
[Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/) if you fiddle around
with the graphics settings a bit.) The idea was that you had a bunch
of spaceships on a hexagonal grid, and you could move them around and
have them shoot at things in a turn-based combat system. I liked that
idea quite a bit and decided to give cloning it a go. Unfortunately I
was nowhere near advanced enough to do things like render real
graphics, but I did at least get a square grid rendered where you
could point and click using the \~same interface as Star Relic to move
things around and shoot. That's what you'll find in this repository.
